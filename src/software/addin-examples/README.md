Geotab provides several examples to learn from and get started developing Geotab Add-Ins.

> The following Add-Ins are intended as learning tools. They were not designed with a production environment in mind and may not work as described outside of a basic fleet configuration.

## MyGeotab Add-in Page Examples

### Heatmap

This Add-In is visualizes the location history of a vehicle by displaying areas of &quot;heat&quot; corresponding to the frequency in which they were at a certain location.

### Proximity

This Add-In is a real-world example of a fully featured Geotab Add-In. Use this Add-In as visual report for determining whether any vehicle has ever been to or near a particular location. With this Add-In you are able to accurately answer the question of &quot;did my driver make this delivery today?&quot;.

Note: This example demonstrates how to use jQuery and Leaflet.

### Rewind

This Add-In is a visual report which allows you to use music player style controls to play, pause, rewind and fast forward the state of your fleet. Use this Add-In to recreate accidents, watch a commute or understand where everyone was at a particular time of day.

### Trips Timeline

A compact visualization of the times vehicles made their trips throughout the day. Scroll through the trips taken by the vehicles over time in a grid format which shows the start and stop of the trip. Selection can be narrowed down based on groups. The user can then select a particular trip and view the trip history of that vehicle for the day selected.
