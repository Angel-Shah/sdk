Geotab provides the ability to use third-party devices in MyGeotab. Third-party devices are defined as any telematics device that is not manufactured or sold by Geotab but is used in conjunction with Geotabâ€™s fleet management platform.

# Getting Started

Integrating a third-party telematics device with MyGeotab requires the use of the MyAdmin SDK. Refer to the [Third-Party Telematics Devices and MyGeotab](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Mddnxc2qKBCNYvVu0-BXcyR-blPlHwa0Zun0mBzZt88/) document for a high-level overview of the registration process or contact your reseller for more information about obtaining a MyAdmin account or API privileges.

To access the third-party telematics device integration process, please visit the [MyAdmin SDK](https://myadmin.geotab.com/sdk/default.html#/thirdParty).
